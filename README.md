# Dicee

A simple web application that simulates a dice game for two players. It randomly rolls two dice images and declares a winner based on the higher dice roll.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Refresh the page to roll the dice and see the results.

## How it Works

- The application generates random numbers for two dice (from 1 to 6) for each player.
- Based on the random numbers, corresponding dice images are displayed.
- The winner is determined by comparing the dice rolls, and the result is displayed at the top.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file with the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web page.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for rolling dice and determining the winner.
- `dice1.png` to `dice6.png`: Dice face images.
